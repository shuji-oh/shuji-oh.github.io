Introduction
------
I am a Cloud Support Engineer at Amazon Web Services since April 2023. 

Before joining Amazon Web Services, I was a Ph.D. student of Computer Science at the Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), where a member of the Internet Architecture and Systems Laboratory (inet-lab). And, from 2021 to 2023, I was a Research Fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (DC2). 

I received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from Hiroshima City University and NAIST, respectively. And, I received Ph.D. degree from the Graduate School of Science and Technology, NAIST. My doctoral research investigated offensive and defensive approaches for the existing automotive or in-vehicle networks and intrusion detection systems.

My research mainly focuses on cybersecurity for cyber-physical systems and their networks. Particularly, I am interested in how to design and evade the automotive intrusion detection system based on physical-layer characteristics (e.g. voltage and delay-time), information entropy, kernel-level system information, and so on.
