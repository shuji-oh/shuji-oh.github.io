Introduction
------
I am a Cloud Support Engineer at Amazon Web Services Japan since April 2023.

Before joining AWS, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), where I was a member of the Internet Architecture and Systems Laboratory (inet-lab) and a Research Fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (DC2) from 2021 to 2023.

Throughout my academic and industrial career, I’ve been fascinated by how widely adopted systems and protocols can behave unexpectedly when pushed beyond their intended use. My research has focused on cybersecurity for cyber-physical systems—especially in-vehicle networks like CAN—where I explored both offensive and defensive techniques. I was particularly drawn to how low-level physical-layer signals (such as voltage and timing anomalies), information entropy, and kernel-level indicators can be used to design or bypass intrusion detection systems.

Even today, I remain interested in systems using SAML or OpenID Connect, where the complexity of trust models and cross-domain behavior can lead to unintended interactions. I enjoy investigating these kinds of protocol or system-level boundaries, especially when they reveal subtle design assumptions or security gaps.
